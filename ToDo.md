## MVP Roadmap (v1.0.0)
1. Basic landing screen
2. Choose a username (FB Login instead?)
3. Two storyboards
  - Take a quiz
    - Beautiful screens with a single multiplication question
    - Numpad for answering
    - Quiz progress indicator(?)
  - Analyze / Where I stand thing (need a name for this)
    - A screen with an absolute "score" and a relative "rank"
4. Every answer and time taken to answer logged using REST API

### Cycle 1
- Hardcoded quiz
- No analyze / where I stand page
- No integration with web API
- Log the JSON that will eventually be sent to the web API in the console on answering each question
- Show only the absolute score in the Analyze page
